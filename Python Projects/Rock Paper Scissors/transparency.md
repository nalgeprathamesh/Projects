## 📜 Transparency Log

### Code Ownership Breakdown

- ✅ **Fully written by me**  
  - Entire game logic, input handling, and result evaluation.  
  - Inspired by the *Snake, Water, Gun* game from CodeWithHarry’s Python course — but I wrote the whole game from scratch.  
  - I improved the structure and efficiency compared to the tutor's version, especially how random choices and game loops are handled.

- ⚙️ **AI-assisted**  
  - Used ChatGPT to better understand the `random` module (e.g., how `random.choice()` works under the hood).  
  - Notes and summaries were AI-assisted — I compiled theory + code into Notion with AI support for clarity and formatting.

- 👨‍🏫 **Tutor-inspired**  
  - Original idea sparked from a game made during CodeWithHarry’s Python course.  
  - No copy-pasting — I rethought the logic and added improvements to make the code cleaner and more modular.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code  
- **Code Formatter**: Black (Microsoft)  
- **AI Tools**: ChatGPT (concept clarifications, note structuring)  
- **Notes and Organization**: Notion

## 🧠 Final Note

This mini-game marks my first steps into building interactive CLI-based Python games.  
I pushed beyond the tutorial by rewriting the logic independently and exploring the `random` module in depth.  
Also got a taste of how even a simple game can be improved with thoughtful structure.

**One small game for Python, one giant leap in confidence 🚀**
