This is the transparency log for the **Secret Agent ID Generator** Python project.

## 📜 TRANSPARENCY LOG

### Code Ownership Breakdown

- ✅ **Fully written by me**  
  - Entire logic and implementation was done by me — from input collection to ID formatting.  
  - The original idea was sparked by a problem prompt given by ChatGPT, but all actual code and flow were independently written by me.  
  - I used modules like `random` and `pyttsx3`, which I had previously learned during the CodeWithHarry Python course.

- ⚙️ **AI-assisted**  
  - ChatGPT was used to generate the initial problem prompt and later to improve the final output formatting — e.g., adding `.upper()` to standardize the generated ID text.  
  - AI also helped in generating notes and summaries that I organized in Notion.  
  - No logic or full blocks were written by AI — I only used AI for minor suggestions and code improvements after I had a working version.

- 🌐 **External References**  
  - I briefly referred to the official `pyttsx3` documentation to understand voice engine basics.  
  - The idea was adapted and expanded into something fun and useful — a voice-assisted ID generator with personality.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code  
- **Code Formatter**: Black (Microsoft)  
- **AI Tools**: ChatGPT (prompting, code refinement, concept explanations)  
- **Voice Module**: pyttsx3  
- **Notes and Organization**: Notion

## 🧠 Final Note

This project let me combine random generation with voice-based interaction — making learning more fun and hands-on.  
It also taught me how small improvements like formatting and casing can boost the usability of a simple script.

**From random numbers to secret missions — just another day in the terminal. 🕵️‍♂️💻**
