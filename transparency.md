# 🧾 Transparency Statement

This file serves as a transparent breakdown of how the code in this folder was created.  
I believe in learning with integrity — and that includes being open about the tools and guidance that helped me along the way.

In this document, you'll find:
- ✅ Code written entirely by me
- ⚙️ Code assisted or improved using AI (like ChatGPT)
- 👨‍🏫 Tutor-guided code (e.g., from courses or walkthroughs)
- 🧠 Code written by tutors or copied as part of a learning module

> This file is included in each project or topic folder to make it clear what’s mine, what’s assisted, and what’s part of the learning process.  
> Transparency matters more than pretending to be perfect.

🔒 This profile includes proof of ownership document to protect authorship and intellectual rights.
