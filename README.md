## 🚀 Why This Exists

I love building things — not just to learn, but to **create something useful, fun, or just cool**.  
This repo is where I turn that energy into actual working code.

Each project includes a `transparency.md` file that shares:
- 👨‍🏫 Whether it was tutor or AI assisted
- 🤖 Tools used (like VS Code, Notion, Black, etc.)
- 📋 Honest commentary about the process — what worked, what didn't

This is more than just code — it's a **transparent, honest record of learning and progress**.

> 🔄 Always improving. I regularly update this repo as I learn new things, improve older code, or add new ideas.
